<p style="Color: black;">Who am I? What am I? What is my path?</p>
<p1 style="Color: Black;">My name is Matthew Liu and at my current stage of life, I have been and am currently
    constructing a strong foundation to increase my chances of finding a set career path. To start off, I have considered
    taking the business path, precisely banking or managing. From past experiences, I have
    matured enough to realize that my personality is fit as someone who is convincing. As an adolescent, some ways to
    gain exposure to the real world, I am attempting to charter the EHS Golf Club, along
    with finding a job this summer. Doing so can strengthen my overall mentality, such as ways to face rejection, facing
    rude people, and managing
    money. </p1>
<br><br><br>
<p1 style="Color: Black;">Growing up, I have come of age to understand my personalities. Some of these personalities
    include team player, persuasive, energetic, natural leader, creative, and alert. In the most recent group project, I
    was assigned as a backend. Though I was not comfortable with my position, I managed to overcome this thought and
    still help out my team with anything they struggled with. Other activities that
    clearly portrayed my personality skills was creating my golf club. As president, leading the
    members and teaching them requires natural leadership skills, which strongly suits me. Furthermore, some
    achievements I have earned from my outside life was starting a lemonade stand with my friend. Although this might seem
    simple, starting a lemonade stand with my friend Artur was both fun and nerve-racking due
    to the fact that I need to shout to grab attention from people. Overall, I was able to face rejection and spend
    quality time with my friend, along with a jump of excitement
    whenever somebody stopped by our stand.</p1>
<br><br><br>
<p1>At my current stage of life, golf has been a significant meaning to me, along with spending more time with family
    and friends. Diving deeper into golf, I am a single handicap player, which is in the top 8%. The majority of my
    family plays
    golf, which is where all my golf skills are made up from. Recently, I went to Tuscon, Arizona to play golf with my
    family and cousin, which proved to be one of the best golf
    courses I have ever played. Moving on from golf, some hobbies I attend to are video games, baking/cooking, and
    basketball. Although I have slowed down in video games, due to the increase of school work, I was once able to achieve
    top 4000 in
    the nation while playing a game called Valorant. This is a small piece of who I am and my current life. If you
    want to learn more about me, contact me at

    <br><br><br>
<p1>Overall, my fifteen years of life has served as a mere reminder that there is an abundance amount to learn in such a short span of time. With more years to come, there are still many lessons to learn and things to improve on, including some of my favorite hobbies. Thank you for your time. </p1>
